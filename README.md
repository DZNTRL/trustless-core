# Pro Web Core #

Repo containing all back-end logic and data access for my professional website. All unit tests can be found in [this repository](add link). 

### Requirements
1. MySQL Server
2. MySQL Workbench (for the model)
3. node.js
4. yarn
5. npx

### Setup

Assuming all of the above requirements are met, the following commands are needed to create a working build. After a working build is established, the core can be referenced in other projects.

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run build`

### Referencing in other projects
There are 2 ways I know of to get a properly-working (with typescript type hinting) reference.
1. Add to some package manager whether it be public (npm, etc) or private (verdaccio, for example)
2. Use the [pro-web-watcher]() repository which will listen for changes to included repos and publish those changes to common yarn workspace `node_modules`
